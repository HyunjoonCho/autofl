Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The most likely culprit method would be related to handling the detection of integer overflow in the `Fraction` class, which is used in the `checkIntegerOverflow` method.\n\nHere are the signatures of some methods that could be potential candidates for further investigation:\n\n1. `Fraction.Fraction(long numerator, long denominator)`\n2. `Fraction.setContinuedFraction(long[] continuedFraction)`\n3. `Fraction.add(Fraction augend)`\n4. `Fraction.subtract(Fraction subtrahend)`\n5. `Fraction.multiply(Fraction multiplicand)`\n6. `Fraction.divide(Fraction divisor)`\n7. `Fraction.max(Fraction other)`\n8. `Fraction.min(Fraction other)`\n9. `Fraction.parse(String string)`\n\nThese are the methods where integer overflow could potentially be checked and an exception thrown if it occurs during fraction operations or parsing strings to fractions."
