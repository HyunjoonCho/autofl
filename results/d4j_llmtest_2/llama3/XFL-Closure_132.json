Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

However, the test failure indicates that this transformation is not happening as expected. Following the execution path, we find that the generated JavaScript code does not match the expected output. This suggests that there might be an issue with the substitution or simplification of the input code.\n\nAfter analyzing the failing test, I believe the following methods are likely to be the cause:\n\n1. PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.substituteAlternates(PatternNode, Node, int)\n2. PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.simplify(Node)\n3. PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.applyPeepHoles(Node)\n\nPlease note that these are just hypotheses based on the available information and may not be accurate. Further investigation is required to confirm the actual cause of the bug.\n\nHere are the method signatures:\n\n1. PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.substituteAlternates(PatternNode, Node, int)\n2.
