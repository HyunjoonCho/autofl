Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The expected result contains characters like \ud842\udfb7, which are not correctly represented in the actual output.\n\nHere's a possible explanation:\n\nThe `testLang720` method is trying to escape the input string using `StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml(input)`, but this might not be doing what we expect. It seems that there could be an issue with how Unicode characters are handled by this method.\n\nAfter examining the source code of the SUT, I found a few methods that seem relevant:\n\n1. `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml(String input)`: This method is likely responsible for escaping the input string, and it might not be doing the job correctly.\n2. `StringEscapeUtils.unescapeXml(String s)`: Although this method is meant to unescape XML strings, it could also be relevant in understanding how Unicode characters are handled.\n\nTo further investigate this issue, I would like to use my 9 available interactions with functions to gather more information about these methods and their internal workings."
