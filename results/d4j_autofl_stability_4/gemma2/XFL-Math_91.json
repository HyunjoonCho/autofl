However, the test fails because the actual result is 0, suggesting that the `compareTo()` method is not correctly handling the comparison between these two very close approximations of PI.  The comment lines before the instantiation of these Fractions suggest that `pi1` is closer to PI - 3.07e-18 and `pi2` is closer to PI + 1.936e-17.\n\nThis discrepancy in comparison results could be due to rounding errors during the construction of the `Fraction` objects or within the `compareTo()` method itself.\n\n\nConclusion: The test `['org.apache.commons.math.fraction.FractionTest.testCompareTo()']` failed...\n"
