Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

            "content": " Based on the provided test case and its failure details, the issue seems to be related to the incorrect implementation of the `equals` or `hashCode` methods in the `ExtendedMessageFormat` class or its dependent classes. To identify potential culprits, I would need access to the source code of these relevant classes.\n\nHowever, without directly accessing their source code, based on common practices and possible misconceptions among developers, I suspect that one of the following methods may have issues:\n\n1. `ExtendedMessageFormat.equals(Object obj)`\n2. `ExtendedMessageFormat.hashCode()`\n3. Any related method used in these two overridden methods from the superclasses\n\nSo, I would recommend looking into the aforementioned methods and their usages in your codebase to identify the root cause of this test failure. The signatures for these methods are as follows:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.lang3.text.ExtendedMessageFormat.equals(Object obj)\norg.apache.commons.lang3.text.ExtendedMessageFormat.hashCode()\n```"
