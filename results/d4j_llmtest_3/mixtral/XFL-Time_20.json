Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The format string \"2007-03-04 12:30 America/Dawson_Creek\" is being treated as invalid at the portion \"_Creek\". This could suggest an issue with how the timezone ID is being processed.\n\nHowever, without direct access to the source code of the `DateTimeFormatterBuilder` and `DateTimeFormatter` classes, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact method causing the issue. That said, here are some methods that might be involved in the parsing process:\n\n1. `DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appendTimeZoneId()`\n2. `DateTimeFormatterBuilder.toFormatter()`\n3. `DateTimeFormatter.parseDateTime(String text)`\n\nThese methods are involved in constructing the formatter and parsing the date-time string. The issue could be due to an incorrect assumption about the format of the timezone ID, a problem with the parsing logic, or an error in the construction of the formatter. To provide a more precise answer, further investigation into these methods would be needed."
