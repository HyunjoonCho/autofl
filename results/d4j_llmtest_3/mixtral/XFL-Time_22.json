Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The signature would be:\n\n```java\norg.joda.time.Duration.toPeriod()\n```\n\nHowever, it's also possible that there's an issue in the `assertEquals()` method call for the 'weeks' field in the test code itself, although this is less likely. The signature for this method in the `junit.framework.Assert` class is:\n\n```java\njunit.framework.Assert.assertEquals(int expected, int actual)\n```\n\nPlease note that without access to the source code of these methods, it's hard to definitively say where the issue lies. These are just the most likely candidates based on the information provided."
