Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

This method is likely calling some other method(s) in the course of its execution, which might be where the error is actually occurring. However, without more information about what these methods do, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the bug.\n\nThat being said, based on the information provided, here are the method signatures that could potentially be involved in the error:\n\n```\ncom.google.javascript.jscomp.PureFunctionIdentifierTest.checkMarkedCalls(...)\ncom.google.javascript.jscomp.PureFunctionIdentifierTest.testLocalizedSideEffects9(...)\n```\n\nThese are the methods that are directly involved in the failing test case. To provide a more accurate diagnosis, I would need more information about the implementation of these methods and any other methods they call. This could include the `PureFunctionIdentifier` class, any methods it calls, and so on."
