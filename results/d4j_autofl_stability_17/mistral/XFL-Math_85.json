However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case.

It returns a list of truncated method signatures (add to the class name to get the full signature). Call example: get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(\"my.favorite.Class\")\n3. get_code_snippet(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns the corresponding code snippet for the method or field. It returns the code snippet for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found. Call example: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n4. get_comments(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns JavaDoc documentation (if available) for the method or field.

The solver in question appears to be using the UnivariateRealSolverUtils from `org.apache.commons.math.analysis.solvers`.\n\nThe root-finding process uses initial, lower bound, and upper bound values that are extremely large (184 digits). This could potentially be causing numerical instability issues or precision errors during computation. The function being tested is the inverse cumulative probability of a Normal distribution, which is related to the Error Function (erf) and Gamma functions.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can try reducing the initial, lower bound, and upper bound values to more manageable numbers or adjusting the solver's settings such as maximum iterations, tolerance level, etc. Another approach could be to check if there are any known edge cases or corner cases in the test data that might be causing this convergence issue."
