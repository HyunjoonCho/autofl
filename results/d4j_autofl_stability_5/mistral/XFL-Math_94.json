This Java function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the \"binary GCD\" method to avoid division and modulo operations. The algorithm used is due to Josef Stein (1961). The function takes two non-zero integers, `u` and `v`, as arguments and returns their greatest common divisor, ensuring it's never zero.\n\n3. Here are the main steps of the algorithm:\n   - If necessary, make both `u` and `v` negative to handle negative numbers effectively.\n   - Find the power of 2 that is common to both `u` and `v`. This is done by repeatedly dividing `u` and `v` by 2 while they are both even and stopping after 31 iterations, as we cannot necessarily negate a negative number without overflow. If the result is 31, an \"overflow: gcd is 2^31\" exception is thrown.\n   - Initialize: `u` and `v` have been divided by 2^k and at least one is odd.\n   - Set `t` to either `v` or the negative half of `u`, depending on whether `u` was odd (`t` will replace `v`) or even (`t` will replace `u`).\n   - Iteratively cast out twos from `t` until it becomes odd.\n   - Reset the maximum between `u` and `v`. If `t > 0`, set `u = -t`; otherwise, set `v = t`. At this point, both `u` and `v` should be odd.\n   - Set `t` to half the difference between `u` and `v` (either positive or negative). If the absolute value of `u` is larger, `t` will be positive; otherwise, it will be negative.\n   - Repeat the previous step until `t` becomes zero. The remaining number represents their greatest common divisor, which is then returned as the result multiplied by 2^k."

This Java function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the \"binary GCD\" method to avoid division and modulo operations. The algorithm used is due to Josef Stein (1961). The function takes two non-zero integers, `u` and `v`, as arguments and returns their greatest common divisor, ensuring it's never zero.\n\n3. Here are the main steps of the algorithm:\n   - If necessary, make both `u` and `v` negative to handle negative numbers effectively.\n   - Find the power of 2 that is common to both `u` and `v`. This is done by repeatedly dividing `u` and `v` by 2 while they are both even and stopping after 31 iterations, as we cannot necessarily negate a negative number without overflow. If the result is 31, an \"overflow: gcd is 2^31\" exception is thrown.\n   - Initialize: `u` and `v` have been divided by 2^k and at least one is odd.\n   - Set `t` to either `v` or the negative half of `u`, depending on whether `u` was odd (`t` will replace `v`) or even (`t` will replace `u`).\n   - Iteratively cast out twos from `t` until it becomes odd.\n   - Reset the maximum between `u` and `v`. If `t > 0`, set `u = -t`; otherwise, set `v = t`. At this point, both `u` and `v` should be odd.\n   - Set `t` to half the difference between `u` and `v` (either positive or negative). If the absolute value of `u` is larger, `t` will be positive; otherwise, it will be negative.\n   - Repeat the previous step until `t` becomes zero. The remaining number represents their greatest common divisor, which is then returned as the result multiplied by 2^k."
