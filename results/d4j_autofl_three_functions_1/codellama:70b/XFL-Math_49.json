The method `OpenMapRealVector#ebeMultiply` is called with argument `v1`.\n2. A new `Iterator<Entry>` named `i` is created using the iterator of the map stored in `u`, which is an instance of `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap`.\n3. While iterating over `i`, if `i.hasNext()` returns true, it will call `i.next()`.\n4. The method `Iterator#next()` in `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap$Iterator` calls the method `advance()`, which updates a field named `lastReturned`.\n5. If `mapHasBeenModifiedSinceCreation` is set to true (which it was), an exception is thrown: \"Concurrent modification detected\".\n6. This exception is caught and rethrown as `MathRuntimeException#createConcurrentModificationException`, which results in the observed error message.\n\nThe issue seems to be that `mapHasBeenModifiedSinceCreation` is being set to true, but it shouldn't be. Let's look at the code for the method `advance()`:\n\n```java\nprivate void advance() {\n    if (current != null) {\n        current = current.next;\n    } else {\n        int bucketIndex = 0;\n        Entry<K,V> candidate = null;\n        while ((candidate == null) && (bucketIndex < buckets.length)) {\n            candidate = buckets[bucketIndex];\n            ++bucketIndex;\n        }\n        current = candidate;\n    }\n    lastReturned = current != null ? current : new Entry<K,V>(null, 0);\n}\n```\n\nIt seems that `current` is never being set to a non-null value, which means it always evaluates as false and `mapHasBeenModifiedSinceCreation` will be true. This can happen if there are no entries in the map when it's initialized. Let's look at the code for the constructor of `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap`:\n\n```java\npublic OpenIntToDoubleHashMap(final int initialCapacity, final double defaultValue) {\n    this(initialCapacity);\n    if (defaultReturnValue != 0d) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"invalid default value\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the constructor you are using (`OpenIntToDoubleHashMap(int, double)`), `this(initialCapacity)` is called, which in turn calls:\n\n```java\npublic OpenIntToDoubleHashMap(final int initialCapacity) {\n    this();\n    if (initialCapacity < 0) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"invalid initial capacity\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `this()` method is being called, which in turn calls:\n\n```java\npublic OpenIntToDoubleHashMap() {\n    this(DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY); // DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY = 16\n}\n```\n\nThis sets the initial capacity to 16. This means that `buckets` is initialized with a length of 16, but there are no entries in it yet. This means that the code for `advance()` will always return null for `candidate`. Since `current` never gets set to anything other than null, `lastReturned` will always be set to a new entry with a key of null and a value of 0.\n\nThis seems like an oversight in the implementation of this method, as it should probably check if the map is empty and only set `mapHasBeenModifiedSinceCreation` to true if there are actual entries in the map. It's likely that this code was intended to iterate over all the entries in the map, but forgot to actually do so, resulting in the bug.\n\nTo fix the issue, you could try initializing `u` with a different constructor that sets a non-zero default value:\n\n```java\nfinal RealVector u = new OpenMapRealVector(3, 1e-6);\n```\n\nThis will result in `mapHasBeenModifiedSinceCreation` being set to false and avoid the exception. However, it's important to note that this is not a definitive fix as it may introduce other issues or unintended behavior. It's always best to report bugs like this to the maintainers of the library so they can address them properly.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help with! \ud83d\ude0a"
