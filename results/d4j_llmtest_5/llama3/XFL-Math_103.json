Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

This exception suggests that the NormalDistribution cumulative probability calculation exceeded the maximum number of iterations. Following the execution path, we find that the calculation is performed in the `NormalDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbability` method. However, this method seems to be performing correctly based on its implementation. \n\nThe issue could lie in how the distribution is set up before calculating the cumulative probabilities. Specifically, lines 130-131 of the test set the mean and standard deviation of the NormalDistribution. If these values are not set correctly, it may lead to incorrect calculations.\n\nAfter analyzing the available information, the most likely culprit methods for this bug could be:\n\n1. `NormalDistributionImpl.setMean(double)`\n2. `NormalDistributionImpl.setStandardDeviation(double)`\n\nPlease note that without additional information or access to the source code, we cannot pinpoint the exact cause of the error with certainty."
