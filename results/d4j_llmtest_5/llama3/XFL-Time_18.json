Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that the error occurs when constructing a `DateMidnight` object with dayOfMonth 29 and the year 1500. This is because in the Gregorian calendar, February only has 28 days, so there cannot be a leap year day on the 29th.\n\nAfter analyzing the test and its failure, I found that the bug likely occurs in one of these methods:\n\n* `org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.getInstanceUTC()`\n* `org.joda.time.field.FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds(int)`\n* `org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology.getDateMidnightMillis(long)`\n* `org.joda.time.base.BaseDateTime.<init>(long)`\n\nPlease note that these methods may not be the only culprits, but they are most likely to be involved in the bug.\n\nHere are their signatures:\n\n- org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.getInstanceUTC()\n- org.joda.time.field.FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds(int)\n- org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology.getDateMidnightMillis(long)\n- org.joda.time.base.BaseDateTime.<init>(long)"
