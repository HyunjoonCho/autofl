Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that the `KeyedObjects2D.getObject` method throws an `UnknownKeyException` when trying to retrieve an object with key `(C2)`, which was previously set using the `setObject` method.\n\nConsequently, it appears that the `KeyedObjects2D.setObject` method is not correctly storing or retrieving objects from the data structure. Specifically, it seems that the keys are not being properly registered, leading to the `UnknownKeyException`.\n\nBased on this analysis, I suggest the following methods as likely culprits for the bug:\n\n* `KeyedObjects2D.setObject(String, String, String)`\n* `KeyedObjects2D.getObject(String, String)`\n\nPlease note that these are just hypotheses based on the available information, and further investigation may be necessary to confirm their involvement in the bug."
