Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

However, the test failure indicates that this calculation is not being performed as expected.\n\nAfter analyzing the failing test and the code, we find that the bug occurs because the hash code calculation does not take into account all relevant factors. Specifically, the `hashCode()` method of the `ExtendedMessageFormat` class is not considering the pattern or registry when calculating the hash code.\n\nFollowing the execution path, we see that the `ExtendedMessageFormat` constructor initializes its internal state based on the provided parameters, but this initialization does not affect the calculated hash code. Therefore, different objects with the same pattern and registry would be considered equal by the `equals()` method but not by the `hashCode()` method.\n\nAs a result, the test failure indicates that the hash code calculation is not correct, which leads to incorrect results when comparing the hash codes of two `ExtendedMessageFormat` objects.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely culprit methods are:\n\n* `ExtendedMessageFormat.hashCode()`\n* `ExtendedMessageFormatExtendedMessageFormat(String, Locale, Map<String, ? extends FormatFactory>)`\n\nPlease let me know if you would like to proceed with further diagnosis or suggestions for fixing the bug."
