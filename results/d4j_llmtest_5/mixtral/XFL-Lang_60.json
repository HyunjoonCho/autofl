Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

However, the `StrBuilder` class and its `contains(char)` method are involved. So, here are the methods that might be related to the issue:\n\n1. `StrBuilder.contains(char)`\n2. `StrBuilder.deleteFirst(String)`\n\nThe error message suggests that the `contains(char)` method is looking beyond the end of the string, which could mean that there's an index out of bounds error in this method. The `deleteFirst(String)` method is also included as it directly modifies the string and could potentially cause issues with the `contains(char)` method if not implemented correctly. \n\nPlease note that further investigation would be needed to confirm these suspicions, including inspecting the source code of these methods."
