Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The constructor of this class is throwing a `MathRuntimeException$4` when it receives a negative value as an argument, which is exactly what happens in your test case. Here are the method signatures that could be the culprit:\n\n```\nPoissonDistributionImpl.<init>(int)\nPoissonDistributionImpl.<init>(double)\n```\n\nThese are the two constructors for the `PoissonDistributionImpl` class, and they are the only methods that are called in the test code you've provided. The error message suggests that the Poisson mean must be positive, but in your test, you're trying to create a `PoissonDistributionImpl` with a negative value (`-1`), which is causing the exception. \n\nPlease note that the actual issue might not be in these method implementations themselves, but in their validation logic for the input arguments."
