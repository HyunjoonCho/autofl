Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The method signature is as follows:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.lang3.SerializationUtils.clone(Class<?> clazz)\n```\n\nThis method is called in the `for` loop of the test at `SerializationUtils.clone(primitiveType)`. The error message indicates that a `ClassNotFoundException` was thrown for the `byte` class, which is one of the primitive types being cloned in this test. This suggests that there might be an issue with how `SerializationUtils.clone()` handles primitive type classes.\n\nHowever, without access to the source code of the `SerializationUtils.clone()` method, it's difficult to definitively say what's causing the bug. It's possible that there's an issue elsewhere in the cloning process or in how the test is set up. But based on the information provided, `org.apache.commons.lang3.SerializationUtils.clone(Class<?> clazz)` seems to be the most likely culprit."
