Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

However, the method under test, `PearsonsCorrelation.getCorrelationPValues()`, seems like a good place to start. This method likely calls other methods within the `PearsonsCorrelation` class to calculate the correlation p-values. \n\nHere's the signature of the method in question:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.math.stat.correlation.PearsonsCorrelation.getCorrelationPValues(int[])\n```\n\nTo properly diagnose the issue, it would be helpful to have tools (functions) that allow access to the source code of the `PearsonsCorrelation` class and its dependencies. With this information, we could trace how the `getCorrelationPValues` method calculates the p-values and potentially identify where it goes wrong.\n\nFor now, I can only provide the signature of the method that is being tested:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.math.stat.correlation.PearsonsCorrelation.getCorrelationPValues(int[])\n```\n\nAdditional tools or information would be needed to provide more accurate suggestions regarding the methods involved in the bug."
