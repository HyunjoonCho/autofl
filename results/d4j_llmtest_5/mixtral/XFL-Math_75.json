Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The error message indicates that the expected value was 0.5, but the actual value was 1.0.\n\nTo further investigate and provide accurate suggestions on potential culprit methods, we would need more information about the system under test (SUT), specifically:\n\n1. The implementation of `FrequencyTest.getPct(E)` method, where E is the type of added values. This method appears to be responsible for calculating and returning the pct value.\n2. Access to other methods potentially involved in the calculation such as those used for adding values (e.g., `FrequencyTest.addValue(E)`) or initializing frequency tables (`FrequencyTest.<init>()`).\n3. The value of 'tolerance' and how it is used within the FrequencyTest class, which appears in line 148 as `f.getPct((Object) (Integer.valueOf(3))),tolerance);`.\n\nWith this information, we could better understand the calculation process for pct values and potentially identify problematic methods that lead to incorrect results."
