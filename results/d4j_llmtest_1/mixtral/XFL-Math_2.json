Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The error occurs in the `HypergeometricDistributionTest.testMath1021()` method, but this method is a test method and should not contain the logic that causes the failure. Instead, the issue is likely to be found in one of the methods called by this test.\n\nIn this specific case, there are two methods being called in the loop: `dist.sample()` and `Assert.assertTrue(String, boolean)`. Here are their signatures:\n\n1. `HypergeometricDistribution.sample()`\n2. `Assert.assertTrue(String, boolean)`\n\nI recommend further investigation of these methods to determine which one is causing the issue. Specifically, checking how `dist.sample()` calculates the sample and ensuring it returns a valid value (greater than or equal to zero).\n\nOnce more information is gathered about these two methods, you will be able to narrow down the potential causes of this bug."
