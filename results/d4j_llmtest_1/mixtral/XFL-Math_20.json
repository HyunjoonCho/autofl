Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

Specifically, it could be an issue with the determination of the upper bound during the optimization process. Here are some methods from the `CMAESOptimizer` class that might be involved:\n\n1. `CMAESOptimizer.optimize(int maxEvaluations, MultivariateFunction fitnessFunction, GoalType goalType, double[] startPoint, double[] lowerBound, double[] upperBound)`\n2. `CMAESOptimizer.doOptimize()` (This method is called within the `optimize` method mentioned above.)\n3. `CMAESOptimizer.reflectPoint(double[] point)` (This method is used in `doOptimize` and could potentially be misbehaving with respect to the upper bound.)\n\nPlease note that this is a preliminary analysis based on the provided test failure. The actual bug might be located elsewhere, but these methods are good starting points for further investigation."
