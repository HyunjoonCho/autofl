Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\n```\nThe test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n```\n\nYou have the following functions available to debug the case:\n\n1. get_failing_tests_covered_classes() - This function retrieves a set of classes covered by failing tests and groups them by their package names.

It returns a list of truncated method signatures (add to the class name to get the full signature). Call example: get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(\"my.favorite.Class\")\n3. get_code_snippet(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns the corresponding code snippet for the method or field. It returns the code snippet for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found.

However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that the issue lies in the implementation of the `gcd` method itself.\n\nThe code snippet provided shows that the method correctly handles cases where either or both of the input values are zero, and also ensures that the result is always non-positive (as required by the definition of GCD). However, it seems that the actual calculation being performed does not accurately compute the GCD for all possible inputs.\n\nIn particular, it appears that the method may be returning incorrect results when the input values are large. This could be due to an overflow or underflow error in the way the method calculates the GCD.\n\nConclusion: The test `testGcd` checks whether the `gcd(int, int)` method in the `MathUtils` class returns the correct greatest common divisor for a given pair of integers.

However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that the issue lies in the implementation of the `gcd` method itself.\n\nThe code snippet provided shows that the method correctly handles cases where either or both of the input values are zero, and also ensures that the result is always non-positive (as required by the definition of GCD). However, it seems that the actual calculation being performed does not accurately compute the GCD for all possible inputs.\n\nIn particular, it appears that the method may be returning incorrect results when the input values are large. This could be due to an overflow or underflow error in the way the method calculates the GCD.\n\nConclusion: The test `testGcd` checks whether the `gcd(int, int)` method in the `MathUtils` class returns the correct greatest common divisor for a given pair of integers. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. The issue lies in the implementation of the `gcd` method itself, which may be returning incorrect results when the input values are large.\n\nNow, it's time to suggest where to fix the bug.
