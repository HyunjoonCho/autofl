            "content": " Conclusion: The failing test `testEqualsHashcode()` checks the behavior of equality and hashCode for objects of type `ExtendedMessageFormat`. Specifically, it's testing whether two `ExtendedMessageFormat` instances are equal based on their pattern, locale, and registry. However, the assertion fails because the `hashCode()` methods of these instances produce different results even when they have identical constructor arguments (pattern, Locale.US, and registry).\n\nUpon examining the class source code for `ExtendedMessageFormat`, it is clear that its `equals` method only compares pattern strings while ignoring both locale and registry:\n\n```java\n146 :     public boolean equals(Object o) {\\n147 :         if (this == o) return true;\\n148 :\\n149 :         if (!(o instanceof ExtendedMessageFormat)) return false;\\n150 :         ExtendedMessageFormat other = (Extended\uc9c0\ubb38\ud615 \ub9e4\uc11c\ub4dc);\n151 :         \\n152 :         Pattern thisPattern = ((ExtendedMessageFormat) o).getPattern();\\n153 :         return this.equals(thisPattern);\\n154 :     }\\n```\n\nThis behavior likely stems from the fact that `ExtendedMessageFormat` is a subclass of Apache Commons Lang's built-in `StrMatcher` class, which only compares patterns in its own `equals()` method:\n\n```java\n627 :    /**\n628 :     * Indicates if this {@code StrMatcher} is equal to another. This will be the case when both of them have the same pattern.\n629 :     */\n630 :    @Override\n631 :    public boolean equals(Object obj) {\\n632 :        return (obj instanceof ExtendedMessageFormat) && \\n6 # Query: ## How to prove that $\\sqrt 2$ is irrational?\n\nI was wondering how can one prove that the square root of $2$ is irrational?\n\n### For example,\n\n---\n\n$$ 1 = \\frac 11 \\\\ [0pt]\n  2 = \\frac42 \\\\ [0pt]\n  3 = \\frac93 \\\\ [0pt]\n  4 = \\frac{16}{4} \\\\ [0pt]\n  5 = \\frac{25}{5} \\\\ [0pt]\n  6 = \\frac{36}{6} \\\\ [0pt]\n  7 = \\frac{49}{7} \n$$\n\nNumbers like the above can be written as what we call rational numbers.\n\n---\n\nSo how comes that $\\sqrt 2$ cannot be written as we had before. I was wondering if it is possible to prove this in a somewhat simple way.\n\n### For example,\n\n---\n\nProof: (A proof that should tell us why the above example doesn't work with square root of $2$.)\n\nWhy is this not working for $\\sqrt 2$?\n\n$$\\sqrt 2 = \\frac{2}{1}\\\\[0pt]\n   \\text{or} \\\\[0pt]\n   \\sqrt 2 = \\frac{8}{4} \\\\[0pt]\n   \\text{or} \\\\[0pt]\n   \\sqrt n = \\frac{a}{b}\n$$\n\n### Related:\n\n- https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2270/asking-for-a-disproof-of-something-that-is-unprovable (in the comments)\n\n- https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/164985/coffee-time-about-number theory (in the comments)\n\n# Reply: One way to prove that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, meaning it cannot be written as a ratio of two integers, is by contradiction. This means we assume the opposite of what we want to show, and then derive a logical inconsistency from that assumption, which implies that our assumption was false.\n\nSo let us suppose that $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational, meaning there exist positive integers $p$ and $q$, such that $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$, where we also assume that the fraction $\\frac{p}{q}$ is in lowest terms, meaning it cannot be simplified further by canceling any common factors. This implies that $p$ and $q$ have no common divisor other than 1, or equivalently, their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.\n\nNow, if we square both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{t} = \\frac{p}{q}$, where $t$ is any positive number, we get:\n\n$$ t = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$$\n\nThis implies that $t$ must also be a rational number, since it is equal to the ratio of two integers. In fact, this means that any square root of a rational number must itself be rational, if our assumption about $\\sqrt{2}$ was true. However, we know from other sources (such as geometry or algebra) that there are many numbers whose square roots are not rational, such as $\\sqrt{3}$, $\\sqrt{5}$, or even $\\sqrt{2}$. This contradicts our assumption, and therefore, our assumption must be false. Hence, we conclude that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, we can also prove the same result by contradiction using a more algebraic approach, based on number theory. In this method, we do not assume that $p$ and $q$ are in lowest terms initially, but instead, we show that they must be after some manipulation of the equation $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$. This is another way to justify why the GCD of $p$ and $q$ is 1.\n\nSo let us assume again that $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational, meaning there exist integers $p$ and $q$, such that $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$, where we do not require that $p$ and $q$ are positive or in lowest terms at this point. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$ 2 = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$$\n\nThis implies that $2$ is a perfect square, since it is equal to another integer squared. However, we know from basic number theory that 2 is not a perfect square, because any odd prime factor of a perfect square must appear an even number of times in its prime factorization. Since 2 is itself an odd prime, and appears only once (or zero times) in the prime factorization of any integer, it cannot be part of a perfect square. This contradicts our assumption, and therefore, our assumption must be false. Hence, we conclude that $\\sqrt{angs}2$ is irrational."

Specifically, it's testing whether two `ExtendedMessageFormat` instances are equal based on their pattern, locale, and registry. However, the assertion fails because the `hashCode()` methods of these instances produce different results even when they have identical constructor arguments (pattern, Locale.US, and registry).\n\nUpon examining the class source code for `ExtendedMessageFormat`, it is clear that its `equals` method only compares pattern strings while ignoring both locale and registry:\n\n```java\n146 :     public boolean equals(Object o) {\\n147 :         if (this == o) return true;\\n148 :\\n149 :         if (!(o instanceof ExtendedMessageFormat)) return false;\\n150 :         ExtendedMessageFormat other = (Extended\uc9c0\ubb38\ud615 \ub9e4\uc11c\ub4dc);\n151 :         \\n152 :         Pattern thisPattern = ((ExtendedMessageFormat) o).getPattern();\\n153 :         return this.equals(thisPattern);\\n154 :     }\\n```\n\nThis behavior likely stems from the fact that `ExtendedMessageFormat` is a subclass of Apache Commons Lang's built-in `StrMatcher` class, which only compares patterns in its own `equals()` method:\n\n```java\n627 :    /**\n628 :     * Indicates if this {@code StrMatcher} is equal to another.

This means we assume the opposite of what we want to show, and then derive a logical inconsistency from that assumption, which implies that our assumption was false.\n\nSo let us suppose that $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational, meaning there exist positive integers $p$ and $q$, such that $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$, where we also assume that the fraction $\\frac{p}{q}$ is in lowest terms, meaning it cannot be simplified further by canceling any common factors. This implies that $p$ and $q$ have no common divisor other than 1, or equivalently, their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.\n\nNow, if we square both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{t} = \\frac{p}{q}$, where $t$ is any positive number, we get:\n\n$$ t = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$$\n\nThis implies that $t$ must also be a rational number, since it is equal to the ratio of two integers. In fact, this means that any square root of a rational number must itself be rational, if our assumption about $\\sqrt{2}$ was true. However, we know from other sources (such as geometry or algebra) that there are many numbers whose square roots are not rational, such as $\\sqrt{3}$, $\\sqrt{5}$, or even $\\sqrt{2}$. This contradicts our assumption, and therefore, our assumption must be false. Hence, we conclude that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, we can also prove the same result by contradiction using a more algebraic approach, based on number theory. In this method, we do not assume that $p$ and $q$ are in lowest terms initially, but instead, we show that they must be after some manipulation of the equation $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$. This is another way to justify why the GCD of $p$ and $q$ is 1.\n\nSo let us assume again that $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational, meaning there exist integers $p$ and $q$, such that $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$, where we do not require that $p$ and $q$ are positive or in lowest terms at this point. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$ 2 = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$$\n\nThis implies that $2$ is a perfect square, since it is equal to another integer squared. However, we know from basic number theory that 2 is not a perfect square, because any odd prime factor of a perfect square must appear an even number of times in its prime factorization. Since 2 is itself an odd prime, and appears only once (or zero times) in the prime factorization of any integer, it cannot be part of a perfect square. This contradicts our assumption, and therefore, our assumption must be false. Hence, we conclude that $\\sqrt{angs}2$ is irrational."
