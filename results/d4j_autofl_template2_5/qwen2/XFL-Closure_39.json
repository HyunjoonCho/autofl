However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case.

It returns a list of truncated method signatures (add to the class name to get the full signature). Call example: get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(\"my.favorite.Class\")\n2. get_code_snippet(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns the corresponding code snippet for the method or field.

Call example: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n3. get_comments(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns JavaDoc documentation (if available) for the method or field.

Specifically, it tests if adding properties with circular references works as expected. The error occurred at line 59 when attempting to print the annotation string representation of the constructed RecordType object.\n\nThe function stack indicates that several classes and methods are involved:\n\n1. `RecordTypeTest.testRecursiveRecord()`: This test method creates a record type by adding multiple properties, including one with another record as its value (`\"loop\": loop`). The test then attempts to convert this record to an annotation string format for comparison.\n\n2. `new RecordTypeBuilder(registry)`: Initializes a new instance of the RecordTypeBuilder class from the JSTypeRegistry.\n\n3. Methods in the `RecordTypeBuilder` are used to add properties to the record type (`addProperty()`) and then build the final `RecordType`.\n\n4. `loop.setReferencedType(record)` sets the referenced type for the loop object, implying that this loop is part of the recursive structure.\n\n5. The issue seems to be related to how the annotation string representation (`record.toAnnotationString()` at line 59) handles or formats circular references in JavaScript objects. The expected and actual annotations do not match due to differences in how they handle recursion.\n\nThe code snippet reveals that the `toAnnotationString()` method plays a critical role here, as it is called on the record type object (`record`) to produce its annotation string representation, which fails the test assertion when compared with an expected string format. The discrepancy likely arises from how this method handles deeply nested or circularly referenced structures in JavaScript types.\n\nThe methods that need fixing are part of the RecordType and RecordTypeBuilder classes, as they seem to be responsible for generating the `toAnnotationString` output:\n\n1. `RecordType`: This class could have a method related to string representation generation that might not handle circular references correctly.\n\n2. `RecordTypeBuilder`: The `build()` method or another method involved in constructing the RecordType might influence its final string representation, especially when properties are nested or reference each other.\n\nTherefore, without directly modifying these classes and methods based on this information alone, we suggest focusing on fixing the following:\n\n- `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.toAnnotationString()`\n- `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordTypeBuilder.build()`"
