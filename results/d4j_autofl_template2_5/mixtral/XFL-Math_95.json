Specifically, when calculating the inverse cumulative probability in the `testSmallDegreesOfFreedom` test case of `FDistributionTest`, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown due to invalid endpoint parameters.\n\nLooking at the code snippet for this method, we can see that it first checks if the input `p` value is 0 or 1 and returns a special value in these cases (0 or positive infinity, respectively). Otherwise, it calls the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of its superclass, `AbstractContinuousDistribution`.\n\nThe error message indicates that the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`, which is likely a utility class used by `AbstractContinuousDistribution`, was called with invalid parameters. Specifically, it seems that the lower bound is set to 0, the initial value is -1, and there is no upper bound.\n\nThe JavaDoc comment for `FDistributionImpl.inverseCumulativeProbability` indicates that this method calculates the critical point x such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the F-distribution is equal to p. It requires a valid probability value as input and throws an exception if it cannot compute the inverse cumulative probability due to convergence or other numerical errors.\n\nGiven these observations, we can conclude that the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method in `FDistributionImpl`, when called with a specific p value during the execution of the `testSmallDegreesOfFreedom` test case, fails to compute the inverse cumulative probability correctly and throws an exception.\n\nTo further investigate this issue, we could examine the code for the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method in more detail, especially the implementation in `AbstractContinuousDistribution`, as well as the utility methods called from it. Additionally, reviewing the test case and its expected behavior would be helpful to determine if there is an issue with the input parameters or assumptions made by the test.\n\nTo address this issue, we might consider the following:\n\n1. Verify that the p value passed to `FDistributionImpl.inverseCumulativeProbability` is within the valid range (0, 1) and meets any other requirements documented in the JavaDoc comment.\n2. Investigate why the utility methods called from `AbstractContinuousDistribution.inverseCumulativeProbability` are producing invalid endpoint parameters. This might involve examining the implementation of these utility methods or checking for issues with their input parameters.\n3. Review other test cases to see if similar issues occur, and ensure that they pass when using the same p value as in `testSmallDegreesOfFreedom`.\n4.
