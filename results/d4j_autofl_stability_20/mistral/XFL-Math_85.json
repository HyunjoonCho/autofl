Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\n```\nThe test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n```\n\nYou have the following functions available to debug the case:\n\n1. get_failing_tests_covered_classes() - This function retrieves a set of classes covered by failing tests and groups them by their package names. It returns a dictionary where keys are package names, and values are lists of simple class names belonging to that package. Call example: get_failing_tests_covered_classes()\n2. get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(class_name) - This function takes a class_name as input and returns a list of method names covered by failing tests for the specified class in the program under test. It returns a list of truncated method signatures (add to the class name to get the full signature). Call example: get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(\"my.favorite.Class\")\n3. get_code_snippet(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns the corresponding code snippet for the method or field. It returns the code snippet for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found. Call example: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n4. get_comments(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns JavaDoc documentation (if available) for the method or field. It returns the comment/documentation for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found. Call example: get_comments(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n\nTo make a function call, respond like the following:\n\n```\nFunction call: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n```\n\nIf you are done and ready to generate a response, respond like the following:\n\n```\nConclusion: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks...\n```\n\nYou will keep these instructions in mind while proceeding.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The error message suggests that there was a convergence issue with the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability for the Normal distribution (`NormalDistributionImpl`).\n\nTo address this issue, you can do the following:\n1. Increase the maximum number of iterations allowed for the solver used in the test method by adjusting the appropriate constant or parameter in the test method. Keep in mind that increasing the number of iterations may affect the overall performance and speed of your tests.\n2. Modify the initial value provided to the solver, making sure it is within a reasonable range for the problem at hand. If necessary, you can provide multiple initial values and check which one gives the best result.\n3. Make sure that the boundary conditions (lower bound and upper bound) are appropriate for the problem. The current values may be too far apart or too close together, causing convergence issues with the solver. You might need to adjust these bounds based on your understanding of the problem domain.\n4. Check if there is any special condition in the test method that requires specific handling or adjustment. For example, if the function `f(x)` has certain properties such as singularities, flat spots, or oscillatory behavior, these may cause convergence issues with the solver. In this case, you may need to modify the solver used (e.g., using a different root-finding algorithm), or adjust the test method to account for these special conditions.\n5.
