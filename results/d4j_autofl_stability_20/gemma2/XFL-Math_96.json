It returns the code snippet for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found. Call example: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n4. get_comments(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns JavaDoc documentation (if available) for the method or field.
