You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\n```\nThe test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n```\n\nYou have the following functions available to debug the case:\n\n1. get_failing_tests_covered_classes() - This function retrieves a set of classes covered by failing tests and groups them by their package names. It returns a dictionary where keys are package names, and values are lists of simple class names belonging to that package. Call example: get_failing_tests_covered_classes()\n2. get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(class_name) - This function takes a class_name as input and returns a list of method names covered by failing tests for the specified class in the program under test. It returns a list of truncated method signatures (add to the class name to get the full signature). Call example: get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(\"my.favorite.Class\")\n3. get_code_snippet(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns the corresponding code snippet for the method or field. It returns the code snippet for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found. Call example: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n4. get_comments(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns JavaDoc documentation (if available) for the method or field.

This exception occurs when the mathematical solver used by Apache Commons Math cannot find a solution within a specified number of iterations. \n\n* **Solver Context:**  Apache Commons Math uses numerical solvers to find roots of functions (where f(x) = 0), solve equations, and perform other mathematical operations.\n\n* **Iteration Limit:** Every solver has a maximum number of iterations it's willing to perform before giving up. This is set to a very large number (`2,147,483,647`) by default, but sometimes solutions can be complex and require more steps.\n\n**Possible Causes & Solutions:**\n\n1. **Function Complexity:**\n   - The function `f(x)` you're trying to solve might be highly non-linear or have multiple roots. This makes it harder for the solver to converge to a solution within the allowed iterations.\n\n   * **Solution:** Try these:\n      - **Increase Iteration Limit:** Raise the maximum iteration count in your code. \n      - **Solver Algorithm Change:** Experiment with different solvers available in Apache Commons Math. Some are better suited for certain types of functions (e.g., `Brent's Method` might be more robust than `Bisection`).\n\n2. **Initial Guess:**\n   - A poor initial guess can lead to divergence. The solver starts its search from a given point (`initial`), and if it's too far from the actual solution, it may struggle.\n\n   * **Solution:** Choose a more informed initial guess based on the function's behavior or known properties. Plot the function to visualize its roots.\n\n3. **Rounding Errors:**\n   - Numerical calculations can introduce tiny errors that accumulate over iterations.\n\n   * **Solution:**  Use higher precision data types (e.g., `double` instead of `float`) if possible, and be mindful of how you handle decimal values.\n\n4. **Function Definition:** \n   - Double-check the correctness of your function definition (`f(x)`). A small typo can significantly impact solver performance.\n\n\n**Debugging Steps:**\n\n1. **Isolate the Problem:** Identify the exact line of code where the `ConvergenceException` is thrown. \n\n2. **Print Values:** Add `System.out.println()` statements to print:\n   - The values of `a`, `b`, and `f(a)` and `f(b)`. This helps understand the context around the exception.\n   - Iteration count at the point of failure. \n\n3. **Plot the Function:** Visualize `f(x)` to get a sense of its behavior, potential roots, and why the solver might be struggling.\n\n\n**Example Code (Illustrative):**\n```java\nimport org.apache.commons.math3.analysis.UnivariateFunction;\nimport org.apache.commons.math3.analysis.solvers.BrentSolver;\n\npublic class SolverExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Define your function here\n        UnivariateFunction f = x ->  x * x - 2; // Example: x^2 - 2 = 0\n\n        // Configure the solver\n        BrentSolver solver = new BrentSolver(); \n        solver.setMaxIterations(1000); // Increase iteration limit\n\n        // Try to find a root within a range\n        double solution = solver.solve(f, 1, 2);  \n\n        System.out.println(\"Solution: \" + solution);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nLet me know if you can provide more context about your specific function (`f(x)`) and the code snippet where the error occurs.
