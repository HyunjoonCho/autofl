However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is.

            "content": "The provided code snippet implements Euclid's algorithm for finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers. Here's a breakdown of the code with explanations:\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe `MathUtils.gcd(int u, int v)` function calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers, `u` and `v`. The implementation uses an efficient algorithm known as \"binary gcd\" which avoids division and modulo operations.\n\n**Algorithm Explanation:**\n\n1. **Handling Zero Values:**\n   - If either `u` or `v` is zero, the GCD is the absolute value of the non-zero number (`Math.abs(u) + Math.abs(v)`). This is a base case since any number's GCD with zero is itself.\n\n2. **Negativity Handling:**\n   - The code ensures both `u` and `v` are negative to avoid potential overflow issues when working with large integers. \n   - Negative numbers can range down to -2^31, while positive numbers are limited by 2^31 - 1.\n\n3. **Finding Powers of Two:**\n   - The `while` loop (`k = 0...`) repeatedly divides both `u` and `v` by 2 as long as they are even and `k` (the power of 2) is less than 31. This step efficiently \"casts out\" common powers of 2 from the numbers.\n   - If `k` reaches 31, it indicates a potential overflow situation, and an `ArithmeticException` is thrown.\n\n4. **Initialization:**\n   -  The variable `t` is initialized based on whether `u` is odd or even. This sets up the next stage of the algorithm.\n\n5. **Iterative Process (B4/B3 - B6/B3):**\n   - The `do...while` loop performs iterative steps to refine `u` and `v`:\n     - It \"casts out twos\" from `t` by repeatedly dividing it by 2 as long as it's even.\n     - Then, based on the sign of `t`, it updates either `u` or `v`. This process continues until `t` becomes zero.\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The GCD is calculated as `-u * (1 << k)`, which effectively takes into account the powers of 2 that were cast out earlier (`k`).\n\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Efficiency:** The binary gcd algorithm is significantly more efficient than using repeated division or modulo operations. It has a time complexity of O(log min(u, v)).\n- **No Division/Modulo:** This implementation avoids division and modulo operations, making it suitable for situations where these are computationally expensive or not available.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions about the code or the algorithm!"

                "content": "The provided code snippet implements Euclid's algorithm for finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers. Here's a breakdown of the code with explanations:\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe `MathUtils.gcd(int u, int v)` function calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers, `u` and `v`. The implementation uses an efficient algorithm known as \"binary gcd\" which avoids division and modulo operations.\n\n**Algorithm Explanation:**\n\n1. **Handling Zero Values:**\n   - If either `u` or `v` is zero, the GCD is the absolute value of the non-zero number (`Math.abs(u) + Math.abs(v)`). This is a base case since any number's GCD with zero is itself.\n\n2. **Negativity Handling:**\n   - The code ensures both `u` and `v` are negative to avoid potential overflow issues when working with large integers. \n   - Negative numbers can range down to -2^31, while positive numbers are limited by 2^31 - 1.\n\n3. **Finding Powers of Two:**\n   - The `while` loop (`k = 0...`) repeatedly divides both `u` and `v` by 2 as long as they are even and `k` (the power of 2) is less than 31. This step efficiently \"casts out\" common powers of 2 from the numbers.\n   - If `k` reaches 31, it indicates a potential overflow situation, and an `ArithmeticException` is thrown.\n\n4. **Initialization:**\n   -  The variable `t` is initialized based on whether `u` is odd or even. This sets up the next stage of the algorithm.\n\n5. **Iterative Process (B4/B3 - B6/B3):**\n   - The `do...while` loop performs iterative steps to refine `u` and `v`:\n     - It \"casts out twos\" from `t` by repeatedly dividing it by 2 as long as it's even.\n     - Then, based on the sign of `t`, it updates either `u` or `v`. This process continues until `t` becomes zero.\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The GCD is calculated as `-u * (1 << k)`, which effectively takes into account the powers of 2 that were cast out earlier (`k`).\n\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Efficiency:** The binary gcd algorithm is significantly more efficient than using repeated division or modulo operations. It has a time complexity of O(log min(u, v)).\n- **No Division/Modulo:** This implementation avoids division and modulo operations, making it suitable for situations where these are computationally expensive or not available.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions about the code or the algorithm!"
