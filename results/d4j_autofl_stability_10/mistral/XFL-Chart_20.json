Instead, it appears to be red.\n\nTo understand this issue better, we first need to find out which part of the code is setting the outline paint for the ValueMarker instance being tested. The covered methods in the ValueMarker class are `getValue()`, and a constructor that takes various arguments, including an outline paint. However, there seems to be no direct method called getOutlinePaint(), so we should look for a related method in the Marker class, which is a superclass of ValueMarker.\n\nThe covered methods in the Marker class include a `getOutlinePaint()` method, which returns an outline paint object. It is likely that this method (or its implementation) is responsible for setting the outline color for the ValueMarker instance in question. This method should be inspected to identify why it's returning red instead of blue."
