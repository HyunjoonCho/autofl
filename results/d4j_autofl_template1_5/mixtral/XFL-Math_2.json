The error is thrown at line 297 during the execution of the `testMath1021` method. To further investigate and fix the issue, you should:\n\n1. Locate the `HypergeometricDistributionTest` class in your project or the library source code.\n2. Go to line 297 and find the `testMath1021` method.\n3. Analyze the assertion that is failing, which should be located near the failed line (check for any `assert*` methods calls). This will give you a clue about what's going wrong in this test case.\n4. Review the code and logic of the related method(s) being tested in the `HypergeometricDistribution` class, especially the ones responsible for the computations that are failing the assertions.\n5. Make necessary adjustments to the implementation or input parameters if required.\n6. Re-run the tests to ensure the fix resolved the issue and didn't introduce new errors elsewhere."

The class `HypergeometricDistribution` has multiple constructors, so we need to be more specific about which constructor's implementation or comments we want to see.\n\nHowever, based on the provided stack trace, I can tell you that the failing test is related to the `HypergeometricDistributionTest` class in the Apache Commons Math library. The error is thrown at line 297 during the execution of the `testMath1021` method. To further investigate and fix the issue, you should:\n\n1. Locate the `HypergeometricDistributionTest` class in your project or the library source code.\n2. Go to line 297 and find the `testMath1021` method.\n3. Analyze the assertion that is failing, which should be located near the failed line (check for any `assert*` methods calls). This will give you a clue about what's going wrong in this test case.\n4. Review the code and logic of the related method(s) being tested in the `HypergeometricDistribution` class, especially the ones responsible for the computations that are failing the assertions.\n5. Make necessary adjustments to the implementation or input parameters if required.\n6. Re-run the tests to ensure the fix resolved the issue and didn't introduce new errors elsewhere."
