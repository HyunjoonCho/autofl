Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\n```\nThe test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n```\n\nYou have the following functions available to debug the case:\n\n1. get_failing_tests_covered_classes() - This function retrieves a set of classes covered by failing tests and groups them by their package names. It returns a dictionary where keys are package names, and values are lists of simple class names belonging to that package. Call example: get_failing_tests_covered_classes()\n2. get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(class_name) - This function takes a class_name as input and returns a list of method names covered by failing tests for the specified class in the program under test. It returns a list of truncated method signatures (add to the class name to get the full signature). Call example: get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(\"my.favorite.Class\")\n3. get_code_snippet(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns the corresponding code snippet for the method or field. It returns the code snippet for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found. Call example: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n4. get_comments(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns JavaDoc documentation (if available) for the method or field. It returns the comment/documentation for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found. Call example: get_comments(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n\nTo make a function call, respond like the following:\n\n```\nFunction call: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n```\n\nIf you are done and ready to generate a response, respond like the following:\n\n```\nConclusion: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks...\n```\n\nYou will keep these instructions in mind while proceeding.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

To debug this issue, you could:\n   - Check if the function being tested (the inverse cumulative probability of a NormalDistribution) is indeed too complex or oscillatory near the root. You might need to check the derivatives of the function and ensure they are well-behaved in the region of interest.\n   - Adjust the solver settings, such as increasing the maximum number of iterations or changing the solver method (e.g., from Brent's method to Newton-Raphson).\n   - Check if there are any special cases or edge conditions that might be causing problems. For example, checking if the input probabilities are outside the valid range (0 <= p <= 1) could help isolate potential issues.\n   - Review the code of the UnivariateRealSolverUtils and AbstractContinuousDistribution classes to ensure they are working correctly. This might involve testing other methods and checking for any logic errors or incorrect implementation of mathematical formulas.\n   - Finally, you could also check if there are any known issues with the version of Apache Commons Math being used, as it is possible that this issue has already been reported and fixed in a later release."
