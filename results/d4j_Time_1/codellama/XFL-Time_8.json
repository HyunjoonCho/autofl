However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

Based on the error message and call stack, it appears that the issue is related to the `forOffsetHoursMinutes` method in the `DateTimeZone` class of the Joda-Time library.\n\nTo start debugging the issue, we can use the `get_failing_tests_covered_classes` function to identify the classes and methods involved in the test execution. This information will help us narrow down the search for potential bugs and understand the context of the error.\n\nBased on the provided input, the following classes and methods are likely to be involved in the failing test:\n\n* `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder` (likely used for constructing the date-time formatter)\n* `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket` (used during parsing of the input date-time string)\n* `org.joda.time.chrono.BaseChronology` (provides the calendar system implementation for the date-time object)\n* `org.joda.time.tz.CachedDateTimeZone` (caches and manages the available time zones)\n* `org.joda.time.tz.FixedDateTimeZone` (represents a fixed time zone with a specific offset from UTC)\n* `org.joda.time.tz.ZoneInfoProvider` (loads the time zone information for the specified location or ID)\n* `org.joda.time.DateTimeUtils` (provides various utility methods for working with date-time objects)\n\nWith this information, we can start examining these classes and methods to see if there are any potential issues that could cause the error message \"Minutes out of range: -15\". We will also need to look at the code within these classes to understand how the `DateTimeZone` class is being used and what values it is accepting.\n\nBased on our analysis, we may find that the issue is related to the fact that the method is not properly validating the input minutes value before using it in the calculation of the offset. We can use various techniques such as debugging, print statements, or unit tests to confirm this hypothesis and identify the exact location where the bug is occurring.\n\nOnce we have identified the issue, we can provide a corrected version of the code that addresses the bug and ensures that the `DateTimeZone` class works correctly in all scenarios."
