However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

This error occurs in the testConstructorEx7_TypeArray_intArray method of org.joda.time.TestPartial_Constructors. The method creates a new Partial instance with the specified types and values, but it looks like the types are not being passed in the correct order to the constructor.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\n* The test is testing the construction of a Partial instance with a type array and an integer value array.\n* The error message \"must be in order\" suggests that the types are not being passed to the constructor in the correct order.\n* The method creates two new DateTimeFieldType arrays, each with three elements: year, dayOfMonth, and monthOfYear.\n* In both cases, the type array is created using the same sequence of types (year, era, monthOfYear), which does not appear to be in the correct order.\n* The method then attempts to create a new Partial instance with these arrays as input, but it looks like the types are not being passed in the correct order, causing the error.\n\nTo debug this issue, we need to determine why the type array is not being passed in the correct order and how to fix it. We can start by looking at the code for Partial's constructor and see if there is a bug or an incorrect assumption that is causing the types to be passed in the wrong order. Alternatively, we can debug the test method line by line to see where the problem lies and make adjustments as needed.\n\nGiven this information, I would suggest calling the following functions to gather more information about the issue:\n\n1. `get_failing_tests_covered_classes`: This function retrieves a list of all classes that have been covered by failing tests in the current JUnit session. It can help us identify which class is causing the problem and if we need to review the code for that specific class.\n2. `get_failing_test_methods`: This function retrieves a list of all methods from the failing test classes that have been covered by failing tests in the current JUnit session.
