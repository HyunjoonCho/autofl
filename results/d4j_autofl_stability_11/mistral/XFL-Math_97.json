This method is supposed to find a root of an equation within the specified range using the Brent's method.\n\n2. get_code_snippet(\"org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverImpl.findRoot(double, double)\")\n    I also found that `UnivariateRealSolverImpl` class is used internally by the Brent's solver to find roots of equations.

Based on these findings, it seems that the problem occurs when the `BrentSolver.solve(double, double)` method is called with inappropriate endpoints or function values at the endpoints do not have different signs.
