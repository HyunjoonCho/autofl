You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\n```\nThe test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n```\n\nYou have the following functions available to debug the case:\n\n1. get_failing_tests_covered_classes() - This function retrieves a set of classes covered by failing tests and groups them by their package names.

Call example: get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(\"my.favorite.Class\")\n3. get_code_snippet(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns the corresponding code snippet for the method or field. It returns the code snippet for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found. Call example: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n4. get_comments(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns JavaDoc documentation (if available) for the method or field.

However, there is nothing in the given code that would cause the p-value to vanish as the number of data points increases.\n\nThe next step is to inspect the test case implementation to understand why the p-values are not behaving as expected:\n\n1. get_comments(\"org.apache.commons.math.stat.correlation.PearsonsCorrelationTest.testPValueNearZero()\")\n    [Function] ```java\n        /*\n         * Create a dataset that has r -> 1, p -> 0 as dimension increases.\n         * Prior to the fix for MATH-371, p vanished for dimension >= 14.\n         * Post fix, p-values diminish but not completely vanish.\n         */\n    ```\n\nThis comment suggests that there was a bug (fixed in MATH-371) where the p-value should have vanished for dimensions greater than or equal to 14, but it only gradually decreased instead. Since the given code does not include any modifications related to MATH-371, the issue might lie somewhere else.\n\nFinally, I would suggest investigating the following:\n\n- Check if there are any other methods in the PearsonsCorrelation class that could affect the calculation of p-values.\n- Review the implementation of the gamma function used to calculate p-values and ensure it is correct for large values of its argument.\n- Validate the test data provided in the test case to make sure it correctly generates a dataset with r -> 1 as dimension increases."
