However, the sine function does not change sign between these two values (since the sine of any positive number is also positive), which leads to the observed error.\n\nIn summary, it appears that there is an issue with how the test is formulated, as it tries to find a root in an interval where the function does not change sign, leading to the `IllegalArgumentException`. The `BrentSolver` seems to be working correctly given a valid problem instance.\n\nFor your reference, here's the Brent solver's relevant code snippet (the one for solving a single root):\n\n```java\npublic E solve(double min, double max) throws MathIllegalStateException, NotStrictlyPositiveException, MaxCountExceededException {\n    ...\n    if (f.value(min) * f.value(max) > 0.0) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Function values at endpoints do not have different signs\");\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nAnd the test code:\n\n```java\ndouble[] interval = new double[] {3.0, Math.PI};\nBrentSolver brentSolver = new BrentSolver(1e-5, 100);\nbracketingNumberOfIterations = 1;\nassertNotNull(\"Unexpected null when solving with Brent solver\", brentSolver.solve(new MathFunction() {\n    @Override\n    public double value(double x) {\n        return Math.sin(x);\n    }\n}, interval[0], interval[1]));\n```\n\nIt's clear that the test is attempting to find a root for the sine function in an invalid interval (where the function does not change sign), which leads to the error."

However, the sine function does not change sign between these two values (since the sine of any positive number is also positive), which leads to the observed error.\n\nIn summary, it appears that there is an issue with how the test is formulated, as it tries to find a root in an interval where the function does not change sign, leading to the `IllegalArgumentException`. The `BrentSolver` seems to be working correctly given a valid problem instance.\n\nFor your reference, here's the Brent solver's relevant code snippet (the one for solving a single root):\n\n```java\npublic E solve(double min, double max) throws MathIllegalStateException, NotStrictlyPositiveException, MaxCountExceededException {\n    ...\n    if (f.value(min) * f.value(max) > 0.0) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Function values at endpoints do not have different signs\");\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nAnd the test code:\n\n```java\ndouble[] interval = new double[] {3.0, Math.PI};\nBrentSolver brentSolver = new BrentSolver(1e-5, 100);\nbracketingNumberOfIterations = 1;\nassertNotNull(\"Unexpected null when solving with Brent solver\", brentSolver.solve(new MathFunction() {\n    @Override\n    public double value(double x) {\n        return Math.sin(x);\n    }\n}, interval[0], interval[1]));\n```\n\nIt's clear that the test is attempting to find a root for the sine function in an invalid interval (where the function does not change sign), which leads to the error."
