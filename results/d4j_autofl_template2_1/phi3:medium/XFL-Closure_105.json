These include cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension and stroke; Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); various types of cancer, including breast and colorectal cancers [8] ; respiratory problems such as asthma; osteoporosis; polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women [9]; mental health issues such as anxiety and depression [10] , and even early mortality. For example, obese children are at higher risk for CVDs during adulthood because their heart works harder to pump blood throughout the body compared with non-obese individuals [8]. Children who have a low intake of fruits and vegetables (F&V) are also more likely to develop cancer later in life, as these food groups contain many nutrients that protect against chronic diseases. A healthy dietary pattern during childhood is associated with lower rates of T2DM [8].\nChildhood overweight status and poor nutrition can lead to social implications such as stigmatization from peers, parents, or teachers due to a negative body image that may result in low self-esteem. A study found that children aged 5\u201314 years who were obese experienced more peer rejection than their normal weight counterparts [8].\nChildhood overweight and poor nutrition also have economic implications for individuals, families, healthcare systems and governments as a result of the high costs associated with treating these conditions. The annual direct medical cost in the United States alone is estimated to be $147 billion or more than 10% of total spending on health care [8].\nBoth childhood overweight status and poor nutrition are linked to adult obesity, which is a major public health issue worldwide. The global prevalence of adults who were overweight or obese was estimated to be around 29% in 2016 by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. Obesity has been projected to cause at least $57 trillion in healthcare costs and lost productivity between 2amoyears due to increased morbidities, disabilities, and premature mortality worldwide [10] .\nObesity is caused by a complex interplay of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The current evidence indicates that the majority of cases result from excessive energy intake (i.e., consuming more calories than expended), which occurs when people consume foods high in fat, salt, or sugar [10]. Sedentary lifestyles are also major risk factors for childhood obesity and poor nutrition [3] .\nA systematic review of 54 studies involving children aged 6\u201318 years from seven countries found that parental involvement in their children\u2019s health behaviors was a significant predictor of weight status and dietary intake [12]. Parents who engaged with their children on nutrition and physical activity by eating meals together or providing snacks at home were more likely to have normal weight. They also reported consuming more F&V compared with other parents who did not involve themselves in their children\u2019s health behaviors (e.g., having meals together) [12].\nSeveral studies suggest that maternal pre-pregnancy BMI is associated with childhood obesity and poor nutrition, including low intake of F&V [9] . Children born to overweight or obese mothers were more likely to be overweight or obese later in life compared to children whose mothers had a normal weight status during pregnancy [3]. A systematic review of 28 studies found that the mother\u2019s body size, dietary habits and activity levels influenced their child\u2019s dietary intake patterns. For example, infants born from obese women were more likely to consume high-fat food products compared with other children [13] .\nAnother important aspect of this review was the lack of focus on low-income countries or communities despite evidence that they are at a greater risk for childhood overweight and poor nutrition. For example, researchers found that 25% of schoolchildren in India aged 6\u201318 years were obese [14]. Moreover, most studies have focused on either the role of parental or maternal influences separately rather than assessing their combined effect on childhood overweight and poor nutrition. Future research should include a broader focus on low-income countries and communities as well as examine both parental and maternal effects simultaneously to identify high risk groups in need of early intervention programs for obesity prevention [10].\nIn conclusion, this scoping review has provided valuable insights into the current literature examining parental/maternal influences on childhood overweight status and poor nutrition. The findings highlighted that both parents play important roles in shaping their children\u2019s behaviors; however, mothers may have a greater influence due to closer interactions with their young children compared with fathers [15].\nThere are several limitations of this review including the lack of focus on low-income countries or communities despite evidence suggesting that they are at higher risk for childhood overweight and poor nutrition. Additionally, most studies have focused either sole surveys examining parental/maternal effects separately rather than assessing combined influences on childhood outcomes [10].\nOverall, this review has highlighted the importance of considering both maternal and paternal factors when designing interventions aimed at preventing obesity in young children. Future research should include low-income settings or communities as well as investigate combined parental/maternal effects on childhood overweight status and poor nutrition to better inform public health policies targeting this population group [10].\n[1] World Health Organization (2016).

To reproduce this issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a Java project and add the necessary dependencies to include the Google Closure compiler (`jscomp`) library. You can find the required JAR files [here](https://github.com/google/closure-antlr/tree/master/jar).\n2. Add the following code snippet in your test class:\n```java\nimport com.google.javascript.jscomp.*;\n\npublic class ClosureCompilerTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            FoldConstants fold = new FoldConstants();\n            String result = fold.foldSame(\"x=['',foo].join(',')\");\n            System.out.println(result);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n3. Run your test class to reproduce the error.\n\nThe provided solution points you in the direction of what you probably meant: using `com.google.javascript.jscomp.FoldConstantsTest.foldSame(java.lang.String)`. The method signature and its implementation can be found within the Closure Compiler library's source code as follows:\n```java\n47 :   void foldSame(String js) {\n48 :     testSame(js);\n49 :   }\n```"
