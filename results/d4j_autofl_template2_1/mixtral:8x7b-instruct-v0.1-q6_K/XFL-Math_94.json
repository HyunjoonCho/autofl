However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is.

This test calls the `gcd` method of the `MathUtils` class with specific arguments (`3 * (1<<20)` and `9 * (1<<15)`) and compares the result to an expected value (`3 * (1<<15)`). The error message indicates that the actual result is `<3440640>`, which does not match the expected value of `<98304>`.\n\nThe `gcd` method from `MathUtils` calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers. According to the provided code snippet, if the product of the input arguments is zero, it returns the absolute sum of these arguments instead of performing the GCD calculation. However, in this case, both inputs are negative and their product is not zero, so this special case does not apply.\n\nLet's examine the provided `gcd` method code to understand why there might be a discrepancy between the expected and actual results:\n\n1. The input values `3 * (1<<20)` and `9 * (1<<15)` are initially processed by removing their common power of 2, which is stored in variable `k`.\n2. Then, one of the inputs (let's say `u`) is made negative, while the other input (`v`) is kept as-is or also negated depending on whether it was odd or even before.\n3. In a loop, the method casts out twos from `t`, and at each iteration, either `u` or `v` is updated with the value of `t`. This process continues until `t` becomes zero.\n4. The final result is calculated as `-u * (1 << k)`, where `k` represents the common power of 2 that was cast out earlier.\n\nNow let's try to find the reason for the mismatch between expected and actual results:\n\n- If there were an issue with integer overflow or underflow, it should have been caught by the `ArithmeticException` on line 435. However, no such exception was mentioned in the error message.\n- There are no apparent issues with the provided code that could cause a discrepancy between expected and actual results for these specific input values. The method appears to be working as intended.\n\nTo further investigate this issue, it would be necessary to analyze the rest of the `MathUtils` class and any related code or configurations. Nonetheless, based on the provided information, the `gcd` method seems to be functioning correctly for these specific input values (`3 * (1<<20)` and `9 * (1<<15)`). It is likely that there might be an issue elsewhere in the test setup or configuration."

In a loop, the method casts out twos from `t`, and at each iteration, either `u` or `v` is updated with the value of `t`. This process continues until `t` becomes zero.\n4. The final result is calculated as `-u * (1 << k)`, where `k` represents the common power of 2 that was cast out earlier.\n\nNow let's try to find the reason for the mismatch between expected and actual results:\n\n- If there were an issue with integer overflow or underflow, it should have been caught by the `ArithmeticException` on line 435. However, no such exception was mentioned in the error message.\n- There are no apparent issues with the provided code that could cause a discrepancy between expected and actual results for these specific input values. The method appears to be working as intended.\n\nTo further investigate this issue, it would be necessary to analyze the rest of the `MathUtils` class and any related code or configurations. Nonetheless, based on the provided information, the `gcd` method seems to be functioning correctly for these specific input values (`3 * (1<<20)` and `9 * (1<<15)`). It is likely that there might be an issue elsewhere in the test setup or configuration."
