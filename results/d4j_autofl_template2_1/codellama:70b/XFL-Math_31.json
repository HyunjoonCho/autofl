You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\n```\nThe test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n```\n\nYou have the following functions available to debug the case:\n\n1. get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(class_name) - This function takes a class_name as input and returns a list of method names covered by failing tests for the specified class in the program under test. It returns a list of truncated method signatures (add to the class name to get the full signature).

Suggested fixes:\n    1. `ContinuedFraction`: Review and debug the `evaluate` method, as it appears to be diverging in some cases.\n    2. `Beta`: Consider using an alternative implementation of the regularized beta function (e.g., using a continued fraction that converges for all input values).\n3.

It appears to be diverging to NaN when the input value is approximately equal to 0.5, which may indicate a bug or limitation of this implementation.\n 2. `BinomialDistribution.cumulativeProbability` - This method calls the `ContinuedFraction.evaluate` method and provides an argument that appears to be the probability value, which is approximately equal to 0.5 in this case. If the continued fraction evaluation fails or returns NaN, it may indicate a bug in how the cumulative probability is being calculated.\n[User] It appears the bug might be due to the incorrect handling of large numbers, resulting in an overflow of the floating-point representation during the calculation. Therefore, I would suggest the following fixes:\n\n1. In `ContinuedFraction`, add a check for values that are too large and handle them differently (e.g., by using a different algorithm or scaling the input).\n2. In `BinomialDistribution`, consider switching to a different method for calculating the ICPF, such as using logs instead of direct calculations.\n[Assistant] Great! You seem to have a good understanding of the code and its limitations. By detecting and handling large values differently in `ContinuedFraction` and considering alternative methods in `BinomialDistribution`, you may be able to address this issue. Keep in mind that any changes should be thoroughly tested and verified before deployment, to ensure they don't introduce new bugs or performance issues."
