However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is.

This means that the iterative solver used to find the value corresponding to a given probability did not converge within the specified maximum number of iterations.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the problem and potential solutions:\n\n**Understanding the Error**\n\n* **Inverse Cumulative Probability:**  This function calculates the value (usually called the \"quantile\") at which a cumulative probability density function reaches a specific target probability. For example, finding the inverse cumulative probability of 0.95 for a standard normal distribution would give you the z-score corresponding to the 95th percentile.\n* **Iterative Solver:** The `NormalDistributionImpl` likely uses an iterative solver (e.g., Newton-Raphson method) to find the root of the equation that represents the inverse cumulative probability. These solvers start with an initial guess and refine it iteratively until a solution is found within a certain tolerance.\n\n**Possible Causes and Solutions:**\n\n1. **Poor Initial Guess:** The solver might be starting with an initial guess that's too far from the actual solution, causing it to diverge.\n    * **Solution:** Investigate how the `NormalDistributionImpl` selects its initial guess for the inverse cumulative probability.  If possible, try providing a better initial guess based on the target probability.\n\n2. **Function Behavior:** The function being solved (related to the normal distribution's PDF and CDF) could have properties that make it difficult to converge. For example, flat regions or sharp changes in slope can cause issues.\n    * **Solution:** This is more challenging to fix directly. You might consider using a more robust solver algorithm designed for functions with these characteristics (e.g., Brent's method).\n\n3. **Numerical Precision:** Floating-point arithmetic can introduce small errors that accumulate over iterations, potentially leading to divergence. \n    * **Solution:** Experiment with increasing the precision of your calculations (if possible) or using libraries that provide higher-precision arithmetic.\n\n4. **Maximum Iterations:** The solver might be hitting its maximum iteration limit before converging.\n    * **Solution:** Try increasing the `maximumIterations` parameter if it's configurable. However, be cautious as a very high number of iterations could indicate an underlying problem.\n\n\n\n**Debugging Steps:**\n\n\n1. **Inspect Code:** Examine the code within `NormalDistributionImpl.inverseCumulativeProbability()` to understand how the solver is implemented and what initial guess it uses.\n2. **Logging:** Add logging statements to track the solver's progress, including the current guess and function value at each iteration. This can help identify if the solver is diverging or stuck in a loop.\n3. **Alternative Solvers:** Experiment with different solver algorithms (if available) to see if they perform better.\n4. **Test Cases:** Create more targeted test cases that cover a wide range of probabilities and distributions to pinpoint where the issue occurs."

This means that the iterative solver used to find the value corresponding to a given probability did not converge within the specified maximum number of iterations.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the problem and potential solutions:\n\n**Understanding the Error**\n\n* **Inverse Cumulative Probability:**  This function calculates the value (usually called the \"quantile\") at which a cumulative probability density function reaches a specific target probability. For example, finding the inverse cumulative probability of 0.95 for a standard normal distribution would give you the z-score corresponding to the 95th percentile.\n* **Iterative Solver:** The `NormalDistributionImpl` likely uses an iterative solver (e.g., Newton-Raphson method) to find the root of the equation that represents the inverse cumulative probability. These solvers start with an initial guess and refine it iteratively until a solution is found within a certain tolerance.\n\n**Possible Causes and Solutions:**\n\n1. **Poor Initial Guess:** The solver might be starting with an initial guess that's too far from the actual solution, causing it to diverge.\n    * **Solution:** Investigate how the `NormalDistributionImpl` selects its initial guess for the inverse cumulative probability.  If possible, try providing a better initial guess based on the target probability.\n\n2. **Function Behavior:** The function being solved (related to the normal distribution's PDF and CDF) could have properties that make it difficult to converge. For example, flat regions or sharp changes in slope can cause issues.\n    * **Solution:** This is more challenging to fix directly. You might consider using a more robust solver algorithm designed for functions with these characteristics (e.g., Brent's method).\n\n3. **Numerical Precision:** Floating-point arithmetic can introduce small errors that accumulate over iterations, potentially leading to divergence. \n    * **Solution:** Experiment with increasing the precision of your calculations (if possible) or using libraries that provide higher-precision arithmetic.\n\n4. **Maximum Iterations:** The solver might be hitting its maximum iteration limit before converging.\n    * **Solution:** Try increasing the `maximumIterations` parameter if it's configurable. However, be cautious as a very high number of iterations could indicate an underlying problem.\n\n\n\n**Debugging Steps:**\n\n\n1. **Inspect Code:** Examine the code within `NormalDistributionImpl.inverseCumulativeProbability()` to understand how the solver is implemented and what initial guess it uses.\n2. **Logging:** Add logging statements to track the solver's progress, including the current guess and function value at each iteration. This can help identify if the solver is diverging or stuck in a loop.\n3. **Alternative Solvers:** Experiment with different solver algorithms (if available) to see if they perform better.\n4. **Test Cases:** Create more targeted test cases that cover a wide range of probabilities and distributions to pinpoint where the issue occurs."
