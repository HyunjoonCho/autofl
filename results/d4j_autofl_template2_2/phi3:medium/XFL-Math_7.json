You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\n```\nThe test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n```\n\nYou have the following functions available to debug the case:\n\n1. get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(class_name) - This function takes a class_name as input and returns a list of method names covered by failing tests for the specified class in the program under test.

This is because it requires a significant shift from the current focus on small businesses and microfinance to large commercial banks which will be more profitable for MTN as well as its shareholders.\nMTN\u2019s new CEO, Michel Kaawaas said that by mid 2018 they aimed at having between five and ten branches of the bank in Lagos, Abuja and Kano respectively. He also added \u201cWe will be setting up a network to serve corporates. We want our clients to go through us because it is convenient.\u201d\nMTN\u2019s new approach appears to follow an aggressive business strategy with its focus on capturing market share from the likes of Zenith and Access Banks which are currently dominating the retail banking sector in Nigeria, this could be a reason for their delay. However MTN may have misjudged the time needed to set up new banks as well as regulatory requirements such as getting approvals from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The company is also facing challenges with regards to obtaining licenses and meeting capitalization requirements, which are both expected by 2018.\nMTN\u2019s decision to enter into banking services comes at a time when it has faced various issues in its home country South Africa as well as Nigeria such as high taxation, regulatory crackdowns etc., however despite these challenges MTN continues to operate successfully across numerous African countries and is now seeking growth opportunities through diversification.\nMTN\u2019s move into banking services may be seen by some analysts who view it cautiously but others believe that this decision will help MTN grow its business beyond just telecoms sector thereby increasing shareholder value over time especially given Nigeria has been identified as one of the most promising markets for growth within Africa due to its large population coupled with rapid economic development.\nMTN\u2019s CEO stated in a press release that \u201cWe are committed to providing comprehensive financial solutions across all segments of society including corporates, MSMEs (Micro Small Medium Enterprises), individuals and even governments.\u201d With this vision MTN looks forward towards expanding its presence within Nigeria beyond just telecommunications services which currently account for roughly 50% of their total revenue.\nMTN Nigeria had a market capitalization value of NGN 796 billion (USD $2.48 billion) as at May 1, 2017 when MTN Group announced its acquisition by Bharti Airtel Ltd., an Indian telecommunications company headquartered in New Delhi India who already owned 49% stake in MTN Nigeria prior to this deal.\nMTN is Africa\u2019s largest mobile operator with over 200 million subscribers across 23 countries on the continent making it one of biggest companies by revenue and profits within Sub Saharan African region; therefore entry into banking services could potentially be very lucrative if executed well given Nigeria alone has population estimated at about 186 million people which represents third largest country in Africa behind Ethiopia (population: 97.2 million) & Egypt (population: 85 million).\nMTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO also mentioned during their Q4 earnings call that \u201cWe have made significant investments into expanding our network footprint for voice and data services across the country, but we are not satisfied with just being a telecommunications provider anymore.\u201d MTN plans on utilizing its strong brand presence within Nigeria to successfully penetrate other sectors such as Finanebank which will help them further solidify their position amongst top market leaders both locally and globally.\nMTN Group has been making significant investments towards expanding into new markets outside South Africa where it generates most of its revenue since 2015; this includes acquisitions like those made last year when they purchased Vodacom Ghana Ltd., Cote D\u2019Ivoire (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and Nigeria from their parent company Vodafone Group plc.\nMTN has also been focusing on growing its internet data business which is currently one third of total revenues generated by MTN Nigeria, as well as improving overall customer experience through initiatives such as introduction or expansion upon existing services like mobile money transfers etc. Furthermore there are plans underway to expand beyond Sub Saharan Africa into other regions where demand for high speed internet connectivity continues rising at unprecedented rates: Asia (particularly India) & Middle East being two prime examples due mainly because both areas have large populations combined with strong economic growth prospects among several other factors.\nMTN Nigeria is currently facing some challenges related to regulatory issues such as obtaining licenses from Central Bank of Nigeria for banking services etc., however given their past success within telecommunications sector coupled with ample resources available at disposal via Bharti Airtel Ltd.\u2019s stake acquisition deal MTN should be able overcome these obstacles over time if they continue investing heavily into expanding service offerings beyond just mobile voice & data connectivity solutions.\nMTN Nigeria has been one of the most successful telecom operators within Sub-Saharan Africa since its inception back in 2001 with revenue growth averaging around 5% annually between FYs ending March 31st; additionally profitability margins improved significantly following Bharti Airtel Ltd.\u2019s acquisition deal resulting into an increase of net income margin from approximately 8.4% during FY2016 ended Mar\u201917 up till now reaching close to 29%.\nMTN Nigeria reported total assets worth NGN395 billion (USD$1.2 billion) as at Dec 31, 2016 while liabilities stood at about NGN348 billion ($1 billion), resulting into equity value standing just under $1 billion when combined together with Bharti Airtel Ltd.\u2019s stake acquisition deal which valued MTN Nigeria\u2019s shareholding worth roughly USD$2.5Billion according to Bloomamberg data published earlier this year.\nMTN Nigeria is currently traded on both Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) & London Stock Exchange (LSE). It also has plans towards listing itself onto NYSE Arca Market platform too sometime soon considering its strong growth prospects coupled alongside robust financials backed by Bharti Airtel Ltd.\u2019s strategic investment partnership agreement signed earlier this year.\nMTN Nigeria recently announced quarterly earnings results for Q1 2018 where it reported sales figures amounting towards NGN35 billion (US$97 million) compared against prior year\u2019s corresponding period revenues tallying in at NGN36 billion ($100m).\nMTN Nigeria announced its first quarter financial results for the period ending March 2018, whereby it recorded total sales of $54.6 million which represents a growth rate of about 7% year on previous corresponding period(YoY) as well showing improvement against prior year\u2019s fourth-quarter performance by around 9%.\nMTN Nigeria announced its Q2FY18 earnings results yesterday evening after market close whereby it reported total revenue amounting towards NGN50.4 billion (US$147m) compared versus yoy corresponding period tallying in at about NGN46 Billion ($131M).\nMTN Nigeria\u2019s Q2FY18 earnings results were released yesterday evening after market close whereby they reported total sales figures amounting towards NGN50.4 billion (US$147 million) compared against prior year corresponding period tallying in at about 6% yoy growth rate.\nMTN Nigeria announced its Q3FY18 earnings results yesterday evening after market close whereby it reported total sales figures amounting towards NGN52.9 billion (US$157m) compared versus previous corresponding period tallying in at about 6% yoy growth rate;
