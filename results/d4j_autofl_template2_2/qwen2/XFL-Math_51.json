However, it failed with an error message indicating that too many evaluations were performed by the solver before finding the root.\n\nThe error occurred at line 52 of `RegulaFalsiSolverTest.java`, where the `testIssue631` method uses the Regula Falsi solver to find a root for a given function:\n\n```java\nfinal UnivariateRealFunction f = new UnivariateRealFunction() {\n    @Override\n    public double value(double x) {\n        return Math.exp(x) - Math.pow(Math.PI, 3.0);\n    }\n};\nfinal UnivariateRealSolver solver = new RegulaFalsiSolver();\nfinal double root = solver.solve(3624, f, 1, 10); // error occurred here\n```\n\nThe problem lies in the `RegulaFalsiSolver` class implementation of the `solve` method. The Regula Falsi solver is using an iterative approach to approximate a root by narrowing down an interval that contains the root. If the solver performs too many iterations, it will throw a `TooManyEvaluationsException`, as shown in the call stack.\n\nUpon examination of the code snippet provided, there doesn't seem to be any specific issue with how the `RegulaFalsiSolver` class is implemented based on this test case alone. The Regula Falsi solver's implementation should handle the situation by checking if it has exceeded a predefined maximum number of evaluations and throwing an exception in such cases.\n\nTherefore, potential methods for fixing this issue could be:\n\n1. `RegulaFalsiSolver`\n2. `solve`\n3. `computeObjectiveValue` (in BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver)\n4. `doSolve` (in BaseSecantSolver)\n5. `BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver`\n\nThese methods are involved in the process of finding a root using iterative approximation techniques, which could be causing excessive evaluations if there is an issue with their implementation or parameters.\n\nTo better diagnose the specific cause of this error and determine where to focus on fixing the problem, it would be necessary to review the actual code implementations of these methods within the Regula Falsi solver class (`RegulaFalsiSolver`) and the base classes that they inherit from. This process would involve analyzing how these methods are called internally, checking for any potential inefficiencies or inappropriate usage of parameters.\n\nBased on this analysis, modifications could be proposed to:\n\n1. Optimize the iterative approximation process by refining the interval selection logic.\n2. Implement a more efficient method for determining when to stop iterations based on convergence criteria or tolerance levels.\n3. Adjust default maximum evaluation counts or provide a way for users to configure these limits.\n\nFixing any of these methods could help ensure that the Regula Falsi solver performs an appropriate number of evaluations without exceeding its specified limit, thus resolving the `TooManyEvaluationsException`."
