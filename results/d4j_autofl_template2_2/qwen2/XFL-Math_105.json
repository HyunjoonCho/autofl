However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case.

It returns a list of truncated method signatures (add to the class name to get the full signature). Call example: get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(\"my.favorite.Class\")\n2. get_code_snippet(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns the corresponding code snippet for the method or field.

However, the test failed with an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the actual result of `getSumSquaredErrors()` is less than 0. By analyzing the code snippet for `getSumSquaredErrors()`, we can see that it computes the sum of squared errors using the formula:\n\n```\nsumYY - (sumXY * sumXY / sumXX)\n```\n\nwhere `sumYY` represents the sum of squares of dependent variable values, `sumXY` is the cross-product of dependent and independent variable values, and `sumXX` is the sum of squares of independent variable values. \n\nThis formula calculates the total sum of squared errors (SSE) in a regression model by subtracting the explained variation (part of the equation that accounts for the variability explained by the model) from the total sum of squares (TSS). A negative SSE value can occur when `sumXY * sumXY / sumXX` exceeds `sumYY`, which might indicate an issue with input data or a problem in how the regression is calculated.\n\nTo determine if this calculation is incorrect, we should examine how the data (`x` and `y`) are being processed by the SimpleRegression instance (`reg`). Specifically, we need to analyze the logic within the for loop where the data points are added:\n\n```java\nfor (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {\n    reg.addData(x[i], y[i]);\n}\n```\n\nWe should verify that `reg.addData()` method correctly updates the sums (`sumXX`, `sumXY`, and `sumYY`) as expected during each iteration. If there's an issue with this method, it could lead to incorrect SSE calculation results.\n\nBased on this information, let's try to identify the root cause of the problem:\n\n1. **Examine the SimpleRegression.addData() implementation**: Look for any issues in how data points are being processed or accumulated by the `addData()` method.\n2. **Check input data validation**: Ensure that no invalid input is being provided, such as NaN or infinite values which could lead to unexpected results during calculations.\n\nSince these locations seem likely candidates for potential bugs based on our analysis:\n\n- `org.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegression.addData(double x, double y)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegression.getSumSquaredErrors()`"
