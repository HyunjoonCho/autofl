The error trace indicates that the exception originates from the `intersection` method of the `SubLine` class.\n\nThe test case involves two `SubLine` instances (`sub1` and `sub2`) which are configured to be parallel and thus should not intersect. However, when the `intersection` method is called with these lines, it appears that one or both of them are in an invalid state, leading to a `NullPointerException`.\n\nThe code snippet from the `intersection` method shows that it first calculates the intersection point on the infinite lines (`v1D`) and then checks whether this point lies within each sub-line's region. If the `remainingRegion.checkPoint(line.toSubSpace(v1D))` or `subLine.remainingRegion.checkPoint(subLine.line.toSubSpace(v1D))` calls result in a null value, it would lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we should ensure that the `sub1` and `sub2` instances are correctly initialized with valid configurations before calling their `intersection` method. Moreover, additional checks should be added in the test case to validate these instances' state prior to performing the intersection operation.\n\nSuggested changes:\n\n1. Add validation checks for `sub1` and `sub2` instances to ensure they are correctly initialized and represent valid sub-lines that do not intersect.\n2. Review the initialization logic of `sub1` and `sub2`, ensuring they are parallel.\n3. Ensure any required conditions, such as `sub1` and `sub2` having different directions, are met before testing their intersection.\n\n[Assistant] Based on your input, I have identified the issue and provided suggestions for validation checks and reviewing initialization logic.
