The test `SimpleRegressionTest.testSSENonNegative()` is checking whether the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) calculated by the `SimpleRegression.getSumSquaredErrors()` method is non-negative. However, the assertion fails, and the error message indicates that the SSE is negative.\n\nTo understand why this might be happening, let's examine the `SimpleRegression.getSumSquaredErrors()` method. The code snippet for this method shows that it calculates the SSE as a difference between the sum of squares of 'y' values (sumYY) and the product of the sum of 'x' multiplied by 'y' (sumXY), divided by the sum of squares of 'x' (sumXX).\n\nNow, let's look at how the `SimpleRegression` object is populated in the test method. The test uses an instance of `SimpleRegression`, and for each pair of 'x' and 'y' values, it calls the `addData(x, y)` method to add data points to the regression model.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that the calculated SSE is negative due to a mathematical inconsistency in the SimpleRegression class or incorrect input data provided by the test case. We would need to investigate the 'addData' method and how the sumYY, sumXY, and sumXX properties are calculated and updated within the SimpleRegression class to pinpoint the issue accurately.\n\nConclusion: The test `SimpleRegressionTest.testSSENonNegative()` checks whether the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) calculated by the `SimpleRegression.getSumSquaredErrors()` method is non-negative, but it fails due to a negative SSE value.

Investigating how this method calculates and updates sumYY, sumXY, and sumXX properties might help identify any inconsistencies that could lead to a negative SSE value.\n2. `SimpleRegression.getSumSquaredErrors()` - This is the method being tested for non-negativity. Understanding how it calculates and returns the SSE could also provide insight into why it sometimes returns a negative value.\n3. `SimpleRegression.update()` - The sumYY, sumXY, and sumXX properties are updated in this private method when new data points are added via the addData(x, y) method. Investigating how these updates occur could help pinpoint any issues causing a negative SSE value.\n\nThese suggestions will be presented as follows:\n\nSimpleRegression.addData(double x, double y)\nSimpleRegression.getSumSquaredErrors()\nSimpleRegression.update()"
