Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

Following the execution path, we find that this exception is thrown when the maximal count of evaluations (100) was exceeded. This suggests that there might be an issue with the evaluation function used in the solver. Since no information about the evaluation function's behavior can be retrieved through direct access, let's look at the `BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver` and related classes.\n\nThe problem is caused by a method in the `BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver` class that does not correctly manage the number of evaluations. This could be either `doSolve`, which seems to call `computeObjectiveValue` multiple times, or `solve`, which might not properly handle its evaluation count.\n\nBased on this information, it is likely that these two methods are the culprits:\n\n1. `BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver.doSolve(...)`\n2. `BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver.solve(...)`\n\nPlease provide me with more opportunities to explore the code if needed."
