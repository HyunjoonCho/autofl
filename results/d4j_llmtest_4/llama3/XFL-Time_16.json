Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. After analyzing the code and test failure message, we find that there's an issue with how the date components are being parsed.\n\nAs the test case expects `2004-05-09T12:20:30.000+01:00` but got `2000-05-09T12:20:30.000+01:00`, it seems that the year is incorrectly parsed as 2000 instead of 2004.\n\nAfter analyzing the code, we find that there's a possibility that this issue arises from how the date and time components are being parsed. Therefore, based on our findings, we suspect that the following methods could be the source of the bug:\n\n- `DateTimeFormatter.parseInto(MutableDateTime, String)`: This method is responsible for parsing the date string into a MutableDateTime.\n- `DateTimeFormat.forPattern(String)`: This method initializes a DateTimeFormat object with the given pattern. It's possible that this method is not correctly configuring the DateTimeFormatter to parse the date components.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to proceed further or provide more details on these methods."
