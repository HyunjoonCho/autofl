Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

By examining the error message and call stack, we find that the value 29 for dayOfMonth exceeds the range [1,28], which is expected by the `DateMidnight` class.\n\nThe issue arises from the `GJChronology.getInstanceUTC()` method returning a Gregorian chronology, which does not support leap years. Consequently, February 29th cannot be represented correctly.\n\nFollowing the execution path, we see that `GJChronology.getInstanceUTC()` is responsible for this behavior. However, it's worth noting that the problem is in the date construction logic itself rather than the tooling or testing framework. Therefore, to fix this bug, you should focus on modifying the date construction logic.\n\nHere are the signatures of the likely culprits:\n\n1. `GJChronology.getInstanceUTC()`\n2. `GregorianChronology.getDateTimeMillis()`\n\nPlease note that these are the most likely locations where the issue might be fixed."
