Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The error message indicates that an array index out-of-bounds exception was thrown at offset 909595230 in the `RandomStringUtils.random` method.\n\nFollowing the execution path, we find that the issue is likely caused by incorrect seeding of the random number generator. This suggests that the `System.currentTimeMillis()` value returned may not be suitable for seeding a pseudorandom number generator, leading to an array index out-of-bounds exception when trying to generate a random string.\n\nThe most likely culprit methods for this bug are:\n\nRandomStringUtils.random(long seed)\nRandomStringUtilsTest.testLANG805()\n\nPlease note that these signatures only include the `random` method and the test case itself."
