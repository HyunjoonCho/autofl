Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The error is thrown at `org.apache.commons.lang3.LocaleUtils.toLocale(LocaleUtils.java:99)`, which suggests that the problem lies in how the locale string is being formatted or constructed.\n\nHere are the method signatures that could be relevant to this issue:\n\n1. `LocaleUtilsTest.assertValidToLocale(String, String, String, String)`\n2. `LocaleUtils.toLocale(String)`\n\nHowever, since `assertValidToLocale` is a test method and it's not supposed to contain the bug, I would focus on the second method, `LocaleUtils.toLocale(String)`, as the most likely culprit for this issue. This method is responsible for converting the locale string into a `Locale` object, and it's where the error is being thrown. It's possible that there's an issue with how this method is handling the input string, particularly in the case of the \"_GB\" value."
